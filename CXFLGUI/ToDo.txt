Create a dynamic theme constructor based off a single primary color. All other elements
should calculate accent/secondary/tertiary colors based off an appropriate amount of
contrast from the primary color. For instance, if the primary color is dark enough,
the global text color should automatically map to white. If the primary color is light
enough, the text color should map to black.

Gradient brushes are fucking infuriating, they should work for MainPage's background, and
did for a couple minutes when being hardcoded. I do not think they can be stored in a resource
dictionary, even though I get the impression they should.

Need to figure out what to do about a docking system. GestureRecognition for panning, and
some kind of custom behavior for the WIP taskbar area so we can add/pop taskbar tabs as needed.
That would allow adding/removing taskbar tabs, but we'd also need something to allow creating
DockLayouts based on the cursor position where a taskbar tab is dropped. AKA this is gonna
be fun.

I want to continue having "DefaultElement.xaml" styles instead of having one big style
collection. It will make it easier to go through and change styling.

I need drop shadows for buttons, GPT recommends putting them in a frame and adding a shadow.

Create new document handling (default constructors...)
